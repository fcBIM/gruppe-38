41934 Advanced Building Information Modeling 2024
We are group 38 and the focus area is Sustainability and materials. Our main objective is to be an analyst and develop a tool to help with a fuller LCA of a building.   
In terms of programming skills we answered this to the following question:  
#### I am confident coding in Python.  
we chose:  
- [x] Disagree.   
<br /> As we are fairly new but are interested in improving this skill.

### The chosen building 
We chose the #2406 building from last years Advanced Building Design course because it seems like the model have all the required data that we need in order for us to develop a relevant tool for our choice of use case.
Claim: 6,74 kgC02eq/m2/year.
Claim is from the ARC report: BEATS -> CO2 -> 6,74 kgC02eq./m2/yr. Source of claim: file CES_BLD_24_06_ARC p. 5. 

## Use Case
How you would check this claim?

When would this claim need to be checked?

What information does this claim rely on?

What phase? planning, design, build or operation.

What BIM purpose is required? Gather, generate, analyse, communicate or realise?

Review use case examples - do any of these help?, What BIM use case is this closest to? If you cannot find one from the examples, you can make a new one.

Produce a BPMN drawing for your chosen use case. link to this so we can see it in your markdown file. To do this you will have to save it as an SVG, please also save the BPMN with it.mYou can use this online tool to create a BPMN file.


A2d: Scope the use case
From the ‘whole use case’ identify where a new script / function / tool is needed. Highlight this in your BPMN diagram. Show this clearly in a new SVG diagram. You may wish to change the SVG diagram, you can use inkscape for this task.
A2f: Information Requirements
Identify what information you need to extract from the model

Where is this in IFC?

Is it in the model?

Do you know how to get it in ifcOpenShell?


A2e: Tool Idea
Describe in words your idea for your own OpenBIM ifcOpenShell Tool in Python.

What is the business and societal value of your tool?

Produce a BPMN diagram to summarise your idea. Save this in a folder in your repository along with an SVG of the disagram and embed the SVG in the Markdown as an image.
